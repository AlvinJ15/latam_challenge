1. I chose the XGBoost model because when analyzing the confusion matrix it had a better result compared to Logistic Regression, having a greater amount of TP and TN, in addition to an F1-score of 0.66 compared to 0.65.
2. I also did different tests increasing the number of fields during training using more fields that I considered relevant 'OPERA', 'MONTH', 'FLIGHTTYPE', 'SIGLADES', 'DIANOM', 'DAY', 'SIGLAORI' , "high_season", "period_day", Using the 70,50, first 40 most important attributes and I was able to observe an increase in precision 0=0.89 1=0.26 and recall 0=0.54 1=0.71, also increasing the amount by 100 to 300 of TP+TN, but as the indications and the tests implemented said, this was not added.
